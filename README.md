# Xtimes
An extension to customise video play speed on Box in order to study more efficiently.

# How to use
This extension works on [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) so that those who want to use this need to install Tampermonkey at first. Then all you have to do is create a new userscripts and paste my script there.
